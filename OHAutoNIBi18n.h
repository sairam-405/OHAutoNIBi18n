/// Call this method as early as possible in your framework life cycle (especially before
/// it loads any storyboard or XIB) to specify the bundle of your framework, and
/// optionally an alternate table name if it's named other than the default "Localizable"

/// @param bundle    The bundle of the framework containing the localization strings file
/// @param tableName The name of the strings file where to look up for localizations
///                  (without the ".strings" or ".stringsdict" extension). Defaults to "Localizable".
